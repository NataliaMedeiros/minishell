What our program should have:
- Display a Prompt:
	Your shell should show a prompt (e.g., $ or myshell>) when it is ready to receive a new command from the user.
	This prompt is typically displayed in the terminal window.

- Working History:
	Implement a command history feature, allowing users to navigate through previously entered commands using the up and down arrow keys.

- Search and Launch Executables:
	Your shell should be able to locate and execute programs based on the PATH environment variable.
	It should also handle relative paths (e.g., ./program) and absolute paths (e.g., /usr/bin/program).

- Signal Handling with Minimal Global Variables:
	Handle signals (e.g., SIGINT for Ctrl+C) in a way that does not interfere with your main data structures.
	Use only one global variable to indicate a received signal, ensuring your signal handler does not modify your main data structures directly.
